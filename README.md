2. Records should be shown in a grid type control with the following information:

  * Contact Name (First and Last)
  * Contact Title
  * Outlet name (outlet that they are associated with using the OutletId)
  * Contact Profile

3. The grid should be sortable
4. Paging should be implemented so that there are 25 contacts per page
5. The grid should be styled so that every other row is highlighted/shaded
6. The application can be in any format you wish (e.g. AngularJS app, static files, nodejs app, MVC App, etcâ€¦) - NOTE: AngularJS is the preferred method.
7. The finished application should have no external dependencies (e.g. a database connection)
8. Feel free to use any third party/open source libraries
9. Delivery of project can be via zip file, GitHub repository or other

##Data Format
Included in this project are two JSON files, one that defines Outlets and one that defines Contacts that belong to outlets. The structure of the data is defined as follows:

| Outlet                   |
|--------------------------|
| Id - int                 |
| Name - string            |
| Contacts - List<Contact> |


| Contact            |
|--------------------|
| Id - int           |
| OutletId - int     |
| FirstName - string |
| LastName - string  |
| Title - string     |
| Profile - string   |

When reading in the JSON data, Contacts should be related to thier parent Outlet.

####Example Outlet Data:
```
{
  "id": 1374048,
  "name": "Educational Marketer"
},
```

####Example Contact Data:

{
  "id": 4415401,
